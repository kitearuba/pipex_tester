## 📖 **Introduction**

**Pipex Tester** is a shell script designed to validate your **pipex** program by running it through various scenarios to check functionality and memory management. The script compares `pipex`'s output with the expected behavior of shell pipes (`|`) and also checks for memory leaks and errors with **Valgrind**.

This tester is a **lightweight, versatile** tool to ensure your **pipex** handles a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and memory management, ensuring it meets project standards.

```

## 🛠️ **Installation**

To install and use the **Pipex Tester**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:kitearuba/pipex-tester.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pipex-tester
   ```

3. **Make Your `pipex` Executable**:
   Ensure that your **pipex** program is compiled and ready to be tested:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

---

## 💡 **Usage**

After compiling **pipex** and setting up the **tester**, simply run the `test_pipex.sh` script:

```bash
./test_pipex.sh
```

This script will execute multiple test cases, display the results for each, and use `diff` to compare output files with expected results. Valgrind memory tests will be shown separately in the output summary.

## 🔍 **Test Cases**

The **Pipex Tester** runs a variety of tests to validate your **pipex** program.

### ✅ **Basic Tests**
- **Test 1**: Executes `cat` followed by `wc -l`.
- **Test 2**: Executes `grep hello` followed by `wc -w`.
- **Test 3**: Handles empty input file with `cat` and `wc -c`.

### ❗ **Edge Case Tests**
- **Test 4**: Attempts to execute with a **non-existent file**, expecting an error.
- **Test 5**: Attempts to execute with an **invalid command**, expecting failure.
- **Test 6**: Handles multiple spaces and tabs in the input file.
- **Test 7**: Handles a **non-readable file** with permission denied.
- **Test 8**: Executes with a single word in the input file.

### 🛠️ **Valgrind Memory Tests**
- **Valgrind Test 1**: Checks memory usage for `cat` followed by `wc -l`.
- **Valgrind Test 2**: Tests memory handling for a **non-existent input file**.
- **Valgrind Test 3**: Validates memory handling for an **invalid command**.
- **Valgrind Test 4**: Checks memory usage with an **empty input file**.

---

## 🔨 **How It Works**

1. **Automated Testing**: The script runs your **pipex** implementation with various inputs, compares output files, and validates error handling.
2. **Valgrind Memory Checks**: Each Valgrind test assesses memory management by looking for leaks or errors, ensuring efficient memory usage.
3. **Clear and Colorful Output**: Test results are shown in **green** for passes, **red** for failures, and each Valgrind result is summarized for easy reading.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The script tests non-standard inputs, invalid commands, missing files, and permission errors, helping your program meet robust project standards.
