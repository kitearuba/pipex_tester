## 📖 **Introduction**

**Pipex Tester** is a comprehensive testing script for validating your **pipex** project. It evaluates the correctness of your program by comparing its outputs against expected results and ensures that your implementation adheres to strict memory management standards by leveraging **Valgrind**.

### Why Use Pipex Tester?
- Automates testing, saving you time.
- Identifies functional errors and edge case failures.
- Ensures efficient memory usage by checking for leaks with detailed leak kind analysis.
- Provides clear and colorful output for easy debugging.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

To install and use the **Pipex Tester**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:kitearuba/pipex-tester.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pipex-tester
   ```

3. **Compile Your `pipex` Program**:
   Ensure your **pipex** program is compiled and ready for testing:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

---

## 💡 **Usage**

After compiling **pipex** and setting up the tester, run the script:

```bash
./test_pipex.sh
```

The script will:
- Run functional tests.
- Compare outputs using `diff`.
- Perform memory checks using **Valgrind** with `--leak-check=full` and `--show-leak-kinds=all`.
- Summarize results for easy debugging.

## 🔍 **Test Cases**

The **Pipex Tester** includes a diverse set of test cases to evaluate your program’s functionality and memory management.

### ✅ **Basic Tests**
- **Test 1**: Executes `cat` followed by `wc -l`.
- **Test 2**: Executes `grep hello` followed by `wc -w`.
- **Test 3**: Handles an empty input file with `cat` and `wc -c`.

### ❗ **Edge Case Tests**
- **Test 4**: Attempts to execute with a **non-existent file**, expecting an error.
- **Test 5**: Runs with an **invalid command**, expecting failure.
- **Test 6**: Handles input files with multiple spaces and tabs.
- **Test 7**: Runs with a **non-readable file** due to permission errors.
- **Test 8**: Handles input files containing a single word.

### 🛠️ **Valgrind Memory Tests**
- **Valgrind Test 1**: Verifies memory handling for `cat` followed by `wc -l`.
- **Valgrind Test 2**: Tests memory management for a **non-existent input file**.
- **Valgrind Test 3**: Checks memory handling for an **invalid command**.
- **Valgrind Test 4**: Verifies memory usage with an **empty input file**.

Each Valgrind test uses:
- `--leak-check=full`: Thorough memory leak checks.
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: Displays details for `definitely lost`, `indirectly lost`, `possibly lost`, and `still reachable` leaks.

## 🔨 **How It Works**

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Runs your **pipex** implementation with predefined inputs.
   - Compares output files with expected results.

2. **Valgrind Memory Checks**:
   - Each test validates memory management by detecting leaks and categorizing them by type.

3. **Detailed Results**:
   - Passes are shown in **green**.
   - Failures are shown in **red** with additional debug information.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Ensures robust handling of invalid files, commands, and permissions.
